# Michaelsoft-Teams

A tribute to the [Michaelsoft Binbows meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/michaelsoft-binbows) and the [fantastic video by Nick Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzAAjzbV5g), Michaelsoft Teams is a fictional video conferencing app interface made for the purpose of being used as a stream overlay.
